## 🚀 Why I Built This

Traditional to-do apps felt robotic — they store tasks but don't help you understand your day. I wanted something smarter: an app that reads my schedule each morning and tells me what to focus on, breaks down big projects into bite-sized tasks, and syncs seamlessly across devices.

Briefday is that app. It combines **React Native, Expo, Firebase, and Claude AI** to deliver a productivity experience that actually feels intelligent.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

```
Framework      React Native (Expo SDK 52)
Language       JavaScript
Auth           Firebase Authentication
Database       Cloud Firestore with real-time sync
AI Engine      Anthropic Claude Sonnet 4
UI Library     React Native Components + Expo Vector Icons
Date Handling  Day.js
Navigation     React Navigation (Stack + Bottom Tabs)
Notifications  Expo Notifications
State Mgmt     React Hooks + Custom Hooks (useTasks, useMeetings)
Deployment     Expo EAS Build → Google Play Store
```

### Architecture Decisions

- **Expo over bare React Native** — Faster development with managed workflow, OTA updates, and simplified build process. No need to touch native code for core features.

- **Firebase Firestore** — Real-time NoSQL database with built-in offline support. Data syncs automatically when the user comes back online. Row-level security through Firestore rules ensures users only see their own data.

- **Custom Hooks Pattern** — `useTasks` and `useMeetings` encapsulate all Firestore logic (add, update, delete, real-time subscriptions). Screens stay clean and focused on UI.

- **Claude AI Integration** — Anthropic's API generates contextual briefings and task breakdowns. Mock responses included for development without API costs.

- **Component-driven architecture** — Reusable components (`PrimaryButton`, `StatsCard`, `ActionButton`) ensure consistency and make the codebase maintainable.

- **Theme constants** — All colors, fonts, and spacing values defined in `constants/theme.js`. Changing the entire app's look requires editing one file.

## 🏃 Running Locally

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- Expo CLI: `npm install -g expo-cli`
- Expo Go app on your phone ([iOS](https://apps.apple.com/app/expo-go/id982107779) | [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=host.exp.exponent))
- A free [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com) account
- (Optional) An [Anthropic API key](https://console.anthropic.com) for real AI features

### 1. Clone the repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/briefday.git
cd Briefday
npm install
```

### 2. Set up Firebase

**Create a Firebase project:**
1. Go to [firebase.google.com](https://firebase.google.com)
2. Click "Create a project" → name it "Briefday"
3. Register a web app (click the `</>` icon)
4. Copy the config object

**Enable Authentication:**
1. Go to **Authentication** → **Get Started**
2. Enable **Email/Password** sign-in

**Create Firestore Database:**
1. Go to **Firestore Database** → **Create Database**
2. Start in **Test Mode** (we'll secure it before production)
3. Choose a server location close to you

### 3. Configure environment variables

Create **`.env`** in the project root:
```
FIREBASE_API_KEY=AIza...
FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=briefday-xxxxx.firebaseapp.com
FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=briefday-xxxxx
FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=briefday-xxxxx.appspot.com
FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=123456789
FIREBASE_APP_ID=1:123456789:web:abcdef
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-your-key-here
```

Replace with your actual Firebase values. Leave `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` empty to use mock AI responses.

### 4. Update app.config.js

Make sure your Firebase credentials are properly referenced in `app.config.js` (already configured if you followed Step 3).

### 5. Run the app
```bash
npx expo start
```

Scan the QR code with:
- **iOS:** Camera app
- **Android:** Expo Go app

## 🔒 Firebase Security Rules

Before deploying to production, update your Firestore rules:

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /tasks/{taskId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == resource.data.userId;
      allow create: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == request.resource.data.userId;
    }
    
    match /meetings/{meetingId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == resource.data.userId;
      allow create: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == request.resource.data.userId;
    }
  }
}
```

---

## 🚢 Building for Production

### Android APK/AAB
```bash
# Install EAS CLI
npm install -g eas-cli

# Configure build
eas build:configure

# Build for Android
eas build --platform android
```

### Google Play Store Submission
